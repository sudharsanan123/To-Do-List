# ToDoList
This is a javascript todo list application. 
You can add/remove todos and search for existing todos in the list.
The UI is built using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, the backend is all done using Javascript.

The user's to-do list is stored in the local storage, so when user refreshes the page, user can always find the list there.
